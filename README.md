# hello-world
my first babeh kitteh

I am Ike.  I own American Geek Computers.  Not to be confused with those scammers called america geeks who have ripped off people for thousands of dollars.  I do not even take credit cards. I had my name first.
I used to code in BASIC when I was young.  I bet most never heard of it today.

This seems like a good place to complete this edit.
